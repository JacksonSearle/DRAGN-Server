# DRAGNTown-Server
This is an implementation (in progress currently) of Stanford's paper "Generative Agents: Interactive Simulacra of Human Behavior"(https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.03442.pdf).
Run main.py to run the server. If there is no game frontend, run move.py to simulate a frontend moving each of the NPC's.

If you are using chatgpt, type this into your terminal so it works: "export OPENAI_API_KEY=<API_KEY>" where <API_KEY> is your actual API key. This will keep your API key seperate from the repository as it will only exist on your system.
