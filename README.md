This project is the backend of a world simulation developed in Unreal Engine 5. We have now implemented a groundbreaking quest giving system that takes the current world as context when generating quests. This helps mitigate Language Model hallucinations.

If you are using chatgpt, type this into your terminal so it works: "export OPENAI_API_KEY=<API_KEY>" where <API_KEY> is your actual API key. This will keep your API key seperate from the repository as it will only exist on your system.

This project started out with us implementing Stanford's paper "Generative Agents: Interactive Simulacra of Human Behavior"(https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.03442.pdf), then adding to it.
